How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The files are kept under staging area before it is put in the repository.

** Value staging area offers, Keep commits small, one commit per logical change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

We can use git diff / git diff id1 id2/ git diff --staged to check the differences in the files in working directory and staging area, differences in files with different commit ids and differences in files 
in staging area and commit ...this helps us to introduce one logical change per commit
